# x = "Peter Pan"

'''
print(x[1:5])
#This code will return "eter" when the code is run. This only pulls the 4 digits as it pulls up to the 5th character but not the 5th character

print(x[:6])
#this pulls the first 6 characters...will return "Peter Pan"

print(x[6:])
#prints from the 6th character to the end of the string and
'''

# print(x[-5:-1])
#this returns characters counting from the left to the right...this example returns "r Pa" because the n = 0 in the array
